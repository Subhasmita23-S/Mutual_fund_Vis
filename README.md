## Interactive Mutual Fund Performance Analysis Dashboard using D3.js
This project presents a browser-based, interactive data visualization dashboard for exploring mutual fund performance and investment patterns. Built using D3.js, it features three main 
components: performance trends over time, expense-return analysis, and asset distribution across fund categories. These visualizations support investor insights by revealing patterns hidden in complex financial datasets.

- Visualized mutual fund performance across 3MO, YTD, 1YR, 3YR, 5YR, and 10YR periods using interactive grouped bar charts.
- Analyzed relationships between expense ratios and fund returns via dynamic scatter plots.
- Explored asset distributions across categories with an interactive treemap showing total assets and fund counts.
- Integrated user interaction features including brushing, sorting, zooming, tooltips, and dropdown filtering for seamless exploration.
